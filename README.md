Survive the Hungry Goblin!

Imagine yourself in the middle of a circular lake, surrounded by water. A malevolent creature known as a Goblin waits hungrily on the ledge, eager to devour you. However, there is an advantage: the Goblin cannot swim.

However, there is an additional obstacle: water reduces your movement speed. As long as you move at a normal pace, the Goblin is incredibly agile, managing to move four times faster than you can on land.

The question is: will you be able to survive this relentless challenge?

Strategy is crucial. If you can make it to the surface of the lake before the Goblin reaches you in the water, then you're safe. Exploit all your swimming skills to overcome the speed disadvantage and reach safety before the Goblin can reach you.

Do you have the courage and skills to win this challenge and escape the terrible Hungry Goblin? The answer will only be revealed when you are at the lake. Good luck!

This is a math question I found on the internet and decided to bring it into a game format.
